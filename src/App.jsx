            <p>“ I was on EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it increcibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-time of my life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

            <h3>Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</h3>
            <p>“ Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particuler, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers, 100% recommend! ”</p>
